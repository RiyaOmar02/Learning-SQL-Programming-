# The following analysis was used on a dataset called chinook (https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/dRmwOLQsS22FVFbXfh3x), which represents a 
# digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

# Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT firstname, lastname, customerid, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA'
;


# How many customers are in each country that is not the US?

SELECT country, COUNT(country)
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA'
GROUP BY country
;


# Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil'
;


# Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date 
# of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.firstname, c.lastname, i.invoiceid, i.invoicedate, i.billingcountry
FROM invoices i
LEFT JOIN customers c
ON i.customerid = c.CustomerId
WHERE i.billingcountry = 'Brazil'
;


# Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE title LIKE 'Sales%Agent'
;


# Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry
FROM invoices
;


# Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, i.invoiceid
FROM employees e
JOIN customers c
    ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
