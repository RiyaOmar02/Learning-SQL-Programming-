# The following analysis was used on a dataset called chinook (https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/dRmwOLQsS22FVFbXfh3x), which represents a 
# digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

# Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

# Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date 
# of the invoice, and billing country.
