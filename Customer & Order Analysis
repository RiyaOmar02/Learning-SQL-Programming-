#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

# Q1. How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;


# Q2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product IS 'iPhone' 
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

# Q3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales sales
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers customers
ON sales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;


# Q4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1

# Q5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT product,
    SUM(quantity) * price AS totalrev
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product

# Q6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity) * price AS totalrev
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product
;


# Q7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum),
